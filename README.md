# Ficflow

Ficflow is a software designed to help you track your fanfiction reading list and organize them the way you want.

## Why Ficflow?

I felt like there was a lack of ways to manage my AO3 reading list (other than having hundreds of tabs opened on my phone or saving the links in my notes), so I decided to work on a solution! It's also my first time making a project in Rust, so if you have any criticism about my approach, feel free to open an issue and teach me!

## Features (Planned, the order is approximate)

- [ ] Finalise a first version of Ficflow available on CLI only
    - [ ] Add a way to list your saved fanfics
    - [ ] Allow users to edit the custom fields (rating, status,...)
- [ ] Implement a function that checks for fic updates
- [ ] Allow users to create shelves and organise more flexibly
- [ ] Create a feature-complete GUI version compatible with all OS
- [ ] Create a rule that automatically checks for updates when the GUI is open and sends notifications to the user in case there is a new one
- [ ] Add a search system based on tags, with an option to filter out fics already catalogued
- [ ] Create a mobile phone app
